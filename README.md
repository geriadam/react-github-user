# Github User Search

Search and view users via the Github API - https://react-github-user-sigma.vercel.app/

## What is this?

A personal project built with React, React Query and other tools to search users and
show their repos on Github. Nothing serious.

Feel free to open issues for questions/improvements!

## Running locally

1. Clone the repository
1. Install dependences `npm`
1. Run the server `npm start`
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000`

### API limit

The Github API has a fairly strict limit.
